# SVG-File-Logo-Generator-
![licenseBadge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-red)

## Description 

This project was created to assist a user in creating a generic logo for any starter project.

### NOTES FOR SUBMISSION

#### Current Issues 

I had some issues when submitting with gitignore - the file does not seem to be ignoring and I continue to troubleshoot, submitting as is for due date but will update.

This project by far was the most challenging project of this course so far, knowing where to start was a challenge. In terms of acceptance crtieria I was able to generate a generic logo, I plan on resubmitting this with jest testing.
